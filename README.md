## Reflection

This was a 2 week side project that I explored to push the boundaries of my frontend development skills! I learned a ton from this project including Client-Side routing with
React Router and how it works when hooked up to an Express backend in deployment (which turned out to be a massive headache but huge learning experience for understanding
and debugging routes in Express! ðŸ˜…). I also learned how to integrate SASS into my development to write cleaner and more reusable CSS within my React Components :). Aside from 
writing code, I got very familiar with Adobe Photoshop 2020 and Adobe XD, and designed my mockups in XD and my space GIFs in photoshop!

This application was bootstrapped with the `create-react-app` boilerplate to handle the initial setup for me. But the final list of technologies used in my project are: 
React, Axios, Body-Parser, Chart.js, Cheerio, Concurrently, Express, Github REST API, GitHub Polyglot, Lodash, Ness.css, Node-Sass, and Request. (Hosted on Heroku ðŸ˜Ž)
